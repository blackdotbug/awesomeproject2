# awesomeproject2

This is an example data visualization project of a flask api backend with a mongo database. 

Leaflet and Plotly are used for the visualizations. Bootstrap is used for design and structure. 

A mapbox access token is required to run the app locally. You can add a `config.js` file to the `static/js` folder, and store the access token in a variable called `MapboxToken`. 

## Deployment:

A second branch has been added to show the difference between setting up an app to run locally and setting it up for heroku deployment.
